# ðŸŒŸ lumenserver

This project implements a robust custom HTTP server in Go, featuring a modular structure, basic routing, middleware support, and request handlers.

## What's this all about?

So, I wanted to dig deeper into how web servers work, and I figured the best way to learn was to build one from scratch. This project is the result of that curiosity - a basic but functional HTTP server that does a bit more than just say "hello world".

Here's what I've managed to pack into this thing:

- A server that actually, you know, serves stuff
- Some basic routing (because we all love to navigate)
- A middleware system (for all that behind-the-scenes magic)
- A structure that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out

## Getting This Thing Running

First things first, you'll need Go installed. I used version 1.16, but anything newer should work too.

1. Grab the code:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MuxN4/lumenserver.git
   ```
2. Head into the project folder:
   ```
   cd lumenserver
   ```
3. Build it:
   ```
   go build
   ```
4. Run it:
   ```
   ./lumenserver
   ```

If all goes well, you should see the server running on `localhost:8080`. Exciting, right?

## ðŸ”¨ Let's Break It... I Mean, Test It!
Alright, now that you've got this bad boy up and running, let's see what it can do! Time to poke it with a stick (or in this case, curl commands) and see how it reacts.

## Curl-ing Up with Your Server
Open up a new terminal window. Your server's feeling lonely in that other one, so let's give it some company:

1. Say hello to your home page:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/
   ```
If it replies with "Welcome to our custom HTTP server!", you're golden!

2. Ask it for the time (because why not?):
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/time
   ```
It should spit out the current time. Fancy, huh?

3. Get a list of users (imaginary friends, perhaps?):
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/users
   ```
You should get a JSON array. Empty? Time to make some friends!

4. Create a new user (finally, a friend!):
   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Eve"}' http://localhost:8080/users
   ```
If Eve appears in JSON form, congrats! You've made a digital friend.

5. Try to visit a non-existent page (let's get lost):
```
curl http://localhost:8080/narnia
```
"404 page not found"? Perfect! Your server isn't making up imaginary places.

## Middleware Madness
Now, let's check if our middleware is doing its job (or just middleware-ing through life):

LoggingMiddleware: Check your server logs. If you see messages popping up like a chatty neighbor, it's working!

RecoveryMiddleware: Time to cause some chaos! Temporarily add this to your TimeHandler:
   ```
   func TimeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      panic("It's panic time!")
   }
   ```
   
Now, try to get the time again:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/time
   ```
If you see "Internal Server Error" instead of your server curling up in a corner, the RecoveryMiddleware is doing its job!

## Make It Your Own

Feel free to tinker with this thing. Add new routes, cook up new handlers, or beef up security with some middleware. Sky's the limit!

## Wanna Contribute?

Found a bug? Think you can make this even better? Go for it! Fork the repo, make your changes, and hit me with a pull request. Just be nice, okay?

## Legal Stuff

This project is under the MIT License. Basically, do whatever you want with it, but don't blame me if something goes wrong.

That's it! Hope you have as much fun playing with this as I did building it. If you've got questions, feel free to reach out. Happy coding! ðŸš€
